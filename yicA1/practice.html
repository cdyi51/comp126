        <p>We don't talk about Bruno no no no we don't talk about Bruno,
        but it was our wedding day it was our wedding day and there wasn't
        a cloud in the sky no clouds allowed in the sky
        bruno walked in with a mischevious grin you're telling the story
        all wrong seven foot frame rats along his back when he calls your name
        it all fades to black if he sees your future 
        i don't remember the lyrics I only watched the movie once
        and it wasn't really that good tbh
