      <p>Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pokémon with powerful
         electrical abilities. Pikachu is the best-known 
         species of Pokémon, largely due to its appearance
          in the anime series as the starter Pokémon of the 
          protagonist, Ash Ketchum. Pikachu is a major 
          character of the Pokémon franchise as well as
           its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years,
         as well as one of the major mascots for Nintendo. </p>
